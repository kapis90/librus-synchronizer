# Librus Synchronizer

Librus Synchronizer is a tool designed to synchronize data from the Librus school management system, enabling users to efficiently manage and access their educational information.

## Features

- **Data Synchronization**: Automatically fetch and update events data from the Librus platform.
- **Secure**: Ensures the safety and privacy of your data.

## Setup

I would recommend to just fork the repository and setup GitHub Actions secrets as follows:

1. Create a service account in Google Cloud Console.
1. Download the JSON key file.
1. Share your calendar with the service accountâ€™s email address (found in the JSON file).
1. Store the JSON key as a GitHub Actions secret (e.g., `G_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`).`
1. Store the Librus account credentials in. `LIBRUS_USERNAME` and `LIBRUS_PASSWORD` as GitHub Actions secrets
1. Store google's calendar ID, as `CALENDAR_ID` secret
1. Customize `run_synchronization.yml` per your needs
